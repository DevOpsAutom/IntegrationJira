FYI ..The DVCS Connector for GitHub.com (the GitHub enterprise connection has no date to move over yet) will no longer be supported as of June 30th, 2019.

Using the old GitHub integration? This gets Digital Team...
The legacy ability to connect Jira Software and GitHub via the Jira DVCS connector is now deprecated in favor of this new GitHub-maintained integration. Note: GitHub Enterprise customers who are using the DVCS Connector will be unaffected at this time. 
Stay tuned for updates on an upcoming Jira Software and GitHub Enterprise integration.
